Let's use Jewel-Osco parking lots in Chicago as a starting point.

Assume that we start at
3531 N Broadway

1. Option A: Go to
    1. 3630 N Southport Ave
    2. 2940 N Ashland Ave
2. Option B: Go to 
    1. 3400 N Western Ave
    2. 2550 N Clybourn Ave

Questions:
- what are travel times of options A and B?
- what community/census blocks are the various addresses in?
    - How many people?
    - How long does it take to travel between points?
    - data from travel survey
    - Demographics?
    - How many tests (Johns Hopkins?)
    - How many positives (Johns Hopkins?)
